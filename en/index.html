			<p>The protest and the crowd may surprise you! Take a photo of the QR for a brief background and explanation, along with
			guidelines and precautions.</p>
			<h2>Background</h2>
			<p>As you are probably aware, Yoon, the ex-president of Korea, attempted a coup on December 3, 2024. The people quickly
			assembled in front of the National Assembly to stop the military, and the opposing party vetoed his martial law on the
			same day. The National Assembly voted to impeach Yoon on December 14, 2024, two (2) weeks later. Now, the ball is in the
			Constitutional Court as they review the case and as we await their ruling.</p>
			<p>Though the impeachment was passed in the National Assembly, the Constitutional Court has yet to give a verdict, nor have
			they announced the date of their ruling. We, the people, continue to gather in Gwanghwan-moon Square to raise our voices
			and display our support for democracy, freedom, justice, and a new vision for Korean society.</p>
			<h2>We are</h2>
			<p>You may ask, what do we mean by the "people"? Well, quite literally, the people. Of course, the major trade unions (such
			as the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions and Korean Metal Worker's Union, Korean Public Service and Transport
			Workers' Union), disability rights groups (Solidary Against Disability Discrimination), LGBTQIA groups along
			with major political parties (영문명 필요) are prominent presences in the Square. Similarly, we have a whole range of agendas
			in alignment with the "new vision" we mentioned above.</p>
			<p>We envision a society where the workers can work in safety and are properly compensated; LGBTQ folks are treated with
			dignity and accepted for who they are; those with disability are treated with dignity and given the right to access
			transport; sexual assault, spycams, and deepfakes are properly punished; and more.</p>
			<h2>Flags</h2>
			<p>You also might be curious about the flags filling the Square. It is one of the protest traditions, where people brought
			flags as a joke to combat the conspiracy that the pro-democracy crowd was, in fact, hired personnel back in 2016. Now,
			the tradition has evolved, and we bring flags representing what we love and cherish and wish to protect in this world.</p>
